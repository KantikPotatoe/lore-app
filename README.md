# 📜 Lore Codex

**A local-first worldbuilding wiki that lives entirely in your browser.**

Write, link, and map the lore of your fictional worlds — inspired by World Anvil
and LoreKeeper. No account, no server, fully offline. Your world never leaves your machine.

## ✨ Why Lore Codex

Everything you write is stored **locally in your browser** via IndexedDB — there's no
sign-up, no cloud, and no network round-trip. It works on a plane, and your lore stays
private by default. Each world is its own isolated database, so you can keep a dozen
settings going at once without them bleeding together.

## 🌟 Features

### ✍️ Writing & linking

| | |
|---|---|
| **Rich-text pages** | Articles for characters, places, factions, items, events, and more — with headings, inline images (no upload), and editable tables for stat blocks. |
| **Wiki links** | Type `[[Page Name]]` to link pages. Renaming a page rewrites every reference automatically; broken links are flagged. |
| **Autolinker** | The first mention of any page's title in your prose links itself automatically — no `[[brackets]]` needed. Toggle it off in Settings. |
| **Citations** | Mark a claim with an in-world source — another page or free text, with an optional locator and quote — and a numbered References list builds itself at the foot of the page. |
| **Hover previews** | Hover a `[[wiki link]]` to peek at the linked page's category, title, and summary in a floating card. |
| **Backlinks & TOC** | Every page shows what links to it, plus an auto-generated table of contents from its headings. |
| **External links** | Attach a URL to selected text; opens in a new tab. |

### 🗂️ Organizing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Multiple worlds** | Fully isolated worlds you can create, rename, banner, delete, and switch between — each its own local database. |
| **Page types & templates** | Colour-coded categories with starter infobox rows and optional starter body sections you can drop into a page in one click. Use the built-ins or define your own; switching a page's type keeps the values you filled in. |
| **Tags** | Tag pages freely and open a tag to see every page that shares it. |
| **Infoboxes** | A per-page sidebar card with image, caption, and typed fields — text, numbers, and `[[reference]]` links — grouped under separator headings. |
| **Image galleries** | Attach a grid of images to a page, view them in a lightbox, reorder them, and promote any one to the page's portrait. |

### 🗺️ Visualizing your world

| | |
|---|---|
| **Interactive maps** | Upload a map image and drop pins linked to lore pages. Draw regions as polygons and nest maps inside one another. |
| **Relationship graph** | A force-directed graph of every page and the links between them — node size shows how connected a page is, surfacing hubs and orphans. |
| **Timeline & calendars** | Define custom calendars (months, eras, year lengths) and place events on a shared timeline — list or zoomable axis. Calendars share one absolute-day axis so events line up. |

### 🔍 Finding things

| | |
|---|---|
| **Full-text search** | A keyboard-driven modal searching titles, summaries, tags, and body content, with highlighted snippets. |

### 💾 Data & safety

| | |
|---|---|
| **Backup & restore** | Export everything to a JSON file and re-import anytime. Import validates the file, shows what it'll replace, writes a recovery backup first, and migrates older backups forward. |
| **Auto-snapshots** | Local snapshots saved automatically (after ~50 changes or 24h of activity); restore any from Settings. |
| **Export as HTML** | Download a self-contained ZIP of your wiki as a browsable static site — index by category, one page per article, with infoboxes, images, citations, and resolved links. |
| **Settings** | Per-world controls for snapshot frequency and retention, the backup-overdue window, and the autolinker — plus backup, import, HTML export, and deleting the world. |
| **Overdue nudges** | The Home screen and the top banner track edits since your last backup and turn red when one is overdue. |

## 🚀 Getting started

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). **First time only:**

```bash
npm install      # download dependencies
```

Then **double-click `start-lore-codex.cmd`** to launch — it opens Firefox at
`http://localhost:5174` and starts the app. Tip: right-click → *Pin to Start* so it
launches like a regular app.

> ⚠️ **Always launch this way.** Your lore is stored in Firefox under the exact address
> `localhost:5174`. Opening a *different* browser or port shows a *different* (empty)
> database — your data isn't gone, it's just tied to the original address. The launcher and
> the pinned port (`vite.config.ts`) guarantee you return to the same place.

<details>
<summary><b>Other commands</b></summary>

```bash
npm run dev      # start manually (also port 5174, hot reload)
npm run build    # type-check + optimized production build → dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build (port 5174)
npm run lint     # ESLint
npm run test:run # run the test suite once (Vitest)
```

## ⚠️ A note on backups

Because your lore lives in this browser under `localhost:5174`, clearing site data,
switching browsers, or opening a different address shows an empty database. So:

- **Always launch with `start-lore-codex.cmd`.**
- **Use Export backup regularly** — keep the JSON files somewhere safe (or in a private repo).
- **Back up each world you care about** — every world is a separate database.

Import is safe by design: it validates the file, shows exactly what you're replacing,
downloads a recovery backup of the current state first, and only then applies the import.
